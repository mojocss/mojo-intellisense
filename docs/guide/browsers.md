Mojo is built using modern CSS features such as Grid Layout and Flexbox, which are not fully supported in older versions of Internet Explorer (IE). Therefore, Mojo does not officially support any version of IE, including IE 11.

Instead, Mojo focuses on providing support for the latest stable versions of popular web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. This allows developers to take advantage of the latest web technologies and to ensure that their projects look and function as expected on a wide range of modern devices.

However, if you need to support legacy browsers like IE11, you may need to use polyfills.

<alert-box type="warning">

        <span class="text-c-orange">Notice:</span>
        Mojo tends to offer its users cutting-edge features like <span class="text-w-bold text-c-invert:+8" default-theme="text-c-invert:-30">backdrop-filter</span> that aren't supported yet by all modern browsers. Therefore, you should use them with caution.
